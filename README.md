**Name:** meow

**Author:** Moizuddin Shah

**Date:** 22-03-2024

**Description:**

This script will print "meow" in the terminal when invoked. The goal is for it to eventually be able to print multiple forms of meow based on a random number generator and if possible, also print out random cat emoticons with the meows. Also in the future we may add options to only print out the text or only print out the cat graphic.

## Help
Print some variation of \"meow\" onomatopeia alongside an emoticon of a cat in the terminal when invoked. Text and emoticon are randomly selected.

**Syntax:** meow [--freeman | {-h | --help} | {-l | large} | --shirley | {-v | --void} | {-V | --version}]

**options:**

--freeman

&emsp;Display ASCII art of Freeman and exit.

-h, --help

&emsp;Print this help and exit.

-l, --large

&emsp;Display a random, large ASCII art of a cat and exit.

--shirley

&emsp;Display ASCII art of Shirley and exit.

-v, --void

&emsp;Display ASCII art of a silly black cat and exit.

-V, --version

&emsp;Print the software version and exit.
